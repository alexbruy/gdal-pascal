GDAL is a translator library for raster geospatial data formats that is
released under an X/MIT style Open Source license by the Open Source
Geospatial Foundation. As a library, it presents a single abstract data
model to the calling application for all supported formats. It also comes
with a variety of useful commandline utilities for data translation and
processing.

The related OGR library (which lives within the GDAL source tree) provides
a similar capability for simple features vector data.
